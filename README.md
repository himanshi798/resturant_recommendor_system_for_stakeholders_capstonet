# resturant_recommendor_system_for_stakeholders_capstonet
In this project we will try to find an location for a restaurant.

Since there are lots of restaurants in toronto we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. We are also particularly interested in areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity. 

We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders. this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening an Italian restaurant in toronto.
